# React Translate Component

A component for [React][1] that utilizes the [counterpart module][2] and the [Interpolate component][3] to translate its content.


## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
% npm install react-translate-component
```


## Usage

*Nothing to see here, yet.*


## Example

The examples code is located at `example` directory. You can clone this repository and run `make install example` and point your web browser to
`http://localhost:3000`. In case you are too lazy for that, we also have a [live demo of the example app][4] on Heroku.


## Contributing

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo and `make install`.

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate: `make test`.

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or are fixing a bug, we need a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
